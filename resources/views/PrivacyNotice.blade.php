				<p>This e-learning compliance site is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information and complies with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) effective from May 2018 and we are registered with the Information Commissioners Office (ICO), in order to make transparent our data handling practices.</p>
				<p>Good information handling makes good business sense and will enhance our reputation and by making sure personal information is accurate, relevant and safe, save both time and money.</p>
				<p>We act as a Data Controller as we keep or process information about living people and hold it on a computer and must comply with certain important rules about how we collect and use personal information.</p>
				<p><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing</strong></p>

				<p>We process on the basis of the following:</p>
				<p><strong>LEGITIMATE INTERESTS</strong> - We only aim to capture and hold data to evidence that an individual has completed a task, training course, quiz, or module on our e-learning compliance site that may be required to be seen by a regulator such as the Financial Conduct Authority, Health and Safety Executive, Finance Lender, Green Deal body etc., or by an organisation as part of their training and ongoing awareness programme. This is likely to be for an individual working on behalf of an organisation to evidence that their staff have taken part and completed certain areas of compliance. We would obtain this information, record it, store it and share it with the individual themselves and the organisation they work for or represent.</p>
				<p>We do not process special category data.</p>
